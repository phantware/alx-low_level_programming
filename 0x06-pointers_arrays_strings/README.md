# 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

## Requirements

### Tasks

0. strcat
   mandatory
   Write a function that concatenates two strings.

Prototype: char *\_strcat(char *dest, char \*src);
This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest

1. strncat
   mandatory
   Write a function that concatenates two strings.

Prototype: char *\_strncat(char *dest, char \*src, int n);
The \_strncat function is similar to the \_strcat function, except that
it will use at most n bytes from src; and
src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
Return a pointer to the resulting string dest

2. strncpy
   mandatory
   Write a function that copies a string.

Prototype: char *\_strncpy(char *dest, char \*src, int n);
Your function should work exactly like strncpy
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strncpy. Run man strncpy to learn more.

3. strcmp
   mandatory
   Write a function that compares two strings.

Prototype: int \_strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
Your function should work exactly like strcmp

4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy
   mandatory
   Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

5. Always look up
   mandatory
   Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes
   mandatory
   Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.

7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody
   mandatory
   Write a function that encodes a string into 1337.

Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
Letters l and L should be replaced by 1
Prototype: char _leet(char _);
You can only use one if in your code
You can only use two loops in your code
You are not allowed to use switch
You are not allowed to use any ternary operation
